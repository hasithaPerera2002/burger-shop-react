This project provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules. It supports two official plugins: `@vitejs/plugin-react` and `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/burger-shop-react.git
   ```
   Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd burger-shop-react
  ```

  Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  
  Run the app:
  
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

This will launch the application with Fast Refresh and ESLint for a smooth development experience.

## ESLint Configuration
If you are developing a production application, consider updating the ESLint configuration to enable type-aware lint rules. Follow the steps mentioned in the Expanding the ESLint Configuration section.
